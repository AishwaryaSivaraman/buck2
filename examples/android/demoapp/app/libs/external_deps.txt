# = What is this file? =
# A list of Maven coordinates for external dependencies used in the project.

# = How is this used? =
# Unlike Gradle, buck2 does not have native support for external dependency management.
# For Java/Android projects at Meta we use a tool called Artificer to resolve the dependency tree
# and generate BUCK files with targets that other modules can depend on.
#
# Artificer code is not open-sourced yet, but we plan to do so. A runnable jar is available for
# download on the GitHub releases page:
# https://github.com/facebook/buck2/releases/tag/androidToolchain%2F2025-04-03

# = How to update dependencies? =
# First download the Artificer jar from GitHub.
# Run:
# `cd buck2/examples/demoapp`
# `java -jar ~/artificer-0.0.1.jar download --log=DEBUG --depth=FULL @app/libs/external_deps.txt`

# See the `.artificer_configs` file for additional information.
